Computer Networks has always been one of my favorite subjects and a key area of interest in my research. Having the opportunity to assist in teaching this course was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had. The highlight for me was designing the final project, which involved building both the client and server sides of a messaging app. This project provided students with a solid understanding of network communication and the complexities involved, while also introducing them to interesting challenges such as encrypting messages within the network.
