This course serves as a gateway for many students in college, helping them gain foundational knowledge in computer science while introducing them to its vast field. Although it's an entry-level course, it plays a crucial role for students as they explore and engage with a variety of concepts in computer science.

This was my first experience as a teaching assistant in an English-language class, and it became a gateway for me as well. It was my first time learning how to communicate with a large number of students in another language. This experience was incredibly valuable as I learned how to coordinate discussion sections, hold office hours, grade assignments and exams, and respond to students' questions via email throughout the course. I was the TA for this course for three semesters, giving me one of the best possible experiences as a teaching assistant.

One of the most effective tools I used in this course was Gradescope. This platform made grading a seamless and enjoyable experience. I hope to use this tool in future teaching opportunities.
