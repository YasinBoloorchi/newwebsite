This was my first experience as a teaching assistant, and it provided me with a fresh perspective on leading tutorial sessions, communicating with students, and maintaining professionalism in academia.

My responsibilities included holding office hours, conducting tutorial sessions, and grading homework and exams. This role not only deepened my understanding of the course material but also offered me valuable insights into writing efficient and reliable code.
